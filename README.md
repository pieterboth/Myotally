Myotally is a User-Friendly Tool for Automated, Accurate Muscle Histology Quantification

This repository contains the Windows- and MacOS- compatible executable files and source code scripts for the Python-based muscle histology image processing software, Myotally. This desktop application is freely available to the scientific community, and we hope it will expedite the pace of muscle research. Myotally is intended to have a highly user-friendly interface. Instructions for use can be found in the supplemental material section of the published validation of this software.
