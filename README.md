# Myotally
Myotally is a user-friendly tool for automated, accurate quantification of myofiber number, cross-sectional area, central nucleation, and mean fluorescence intensity from IHC stains of muscle cross sections. This repository contains the Windows- and MacOS- compatible executable files and source code scripts for the Python-based muscle histology image processing software, Myotally. This desktop application is freely available to the scientific community, and we hope it will expedite the pace of muscle research. Myotally is intended to have a highly user-friendly interface. Instructions for use can be found in the published validation of this software. Please cite the software in our initial publication by the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.14197515 . If you have questions about using Myotally, please reach out to the corresponding author.

Thank You,
Pieter Both, PhD
